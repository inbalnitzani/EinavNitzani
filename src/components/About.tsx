    <h2>About Einav</h2>
    <p>
    Einav Nitzani is a filmmaker and MFA candidate at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, where she received the Graduate Film Scholarship. Her work blends humor and melancholy, often finding light in emotionally complex or painful situations. Her award-winning short As Stars Out There (2022) screened internationally at GEMS Vancouver, the UK Jewish Film Festival, and the New York Shorts International Film Festival. At Tisch, she wrote and directed several short films including Hang, Swang, Vera Wang (16mm), Gefile-Fishi, Dawn, and the documentary Bosmat. She has also produced films by Oriana Ng and Yuqian Zhang, and designed sets and costumes for Paul Rosenfeld’s Omi and Opa. Prior to NYU, Einav worked in music rights and media development, and produced commercials and political campaign content. She holds an Honors B.A. in Film and Art History from Tel Aviv University. Her storytelling is emotionally resonant, socially observant, and always just a little offbeat.
